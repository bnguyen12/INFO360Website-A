                    <h2>Financial Aid</h2>
                    <h4>FASFA</h4>
                    <p>
                      The <b>FASFA</b>, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is a form
                      students submit to be considered for federal and state student financial aid.
                      To apply, go to <a class="hlink" href="http://fafsa.gov"><b>http://fafsa.gov</b></a> and follow the directions to file the FAFSA
                      (and signature page if directed to do so). You will need an FSA ID to log in.
                      If you donâ€™t have one, go to <a class="hlink" href="https://fsaid.ed.gov">https://fsaid.ed.gov</a> to apply for an FSA ID from
                      the U.S. Department of Education. File your FAFSA as soon after
                      October 1 as possible, noting University of Washington, Code 003798 on the
                      form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you do not want to use FAFSA on the Web, you can obtain a paper version
                      FAFSA from a high school counselor, a local college, or by calling 1-800-4FEDAID.
                      All applications must be received by the federal processor by January 15 for the
                      upcoming school year for priority consideration for our aid programs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The 2019 FAFSA is due on <b>January 15, 2019</b>. In general, students whose FAFSAs are received after January 15,
                      part-time and post-baccalaureate (5th year) students are considered for limited types of aid. After January 15,
                      we recommend that the FAFSA be submitted as early as possible before the beginning of the quarter in which you
                      wish to receive aid. Less than full-time students and late applicants with exceptional circumstances may contact our office.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Continued Eligiblity</h4>
                    <p>
                      Once you have been awarded your financial aid, you must meet certain eligibility requirements to keep it.
                      For example, you must maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) in your course of study and remained
                      enrolled for the minimum number of credits required for the financial aid programs you received.
                      In addition, you must maintain the grade point average (GPA) required by the University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The aid awarded to you was based on your FAFSA information, your financial circumstances, enrollment
                      plans and SAP status as originally reported. If you receive additional aid or if your circumstances
                      change, OSFA may be required to make award adjustments. Because of this you are required to notify OSFA if:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          You receive any additional financial aid (scholarships, grants and loans) and any other educational or tuition assistance
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Receipt or loss of a Graduate Teaching, Research Assistantship, Fellowship, Traineeship or Resident Advisor
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You change from living with parent or relative to living in a University residence hall or off campus or vice versa
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You withdraw from the University prior to the first day of the quarter
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you do not report these changes to the financial aid office in a timely manner, you may not receive your aid,
                      you may not receive your aid when you need it, you might owe some or all of your aid back or your aid may be reduced at
                      short notice to you.
                    </p>
