                    The mission of this web application is to be an accessible resource to learn how
                    one could pursue further education after incarceration. For those who haven't 
                    been incarcerated but want to learn about the divide between the general public
                    and the stereotypic former-inmates, this is the resource for that!

                            <p>
                                While the internet is abundant with information, rarely do we see
                                resources that cater towards different spectrums of devices. Some may
                                only have access to smartphones, laptops, or tablets. However, the format
                                of a website/application tends to be more fit towards one device, whereas
                                we want to have this website scale to be seen through many diverse
                                mediums
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Considering the length of time people get out of prison varies, their
                                inclination towards technology varies widely as well. Some people that
                                haven't used a computer in 10 years or even those that have never used
                                a smartphone will find it hard to navigate through an online resource
                                if it's cluttered. For example, we've made sure that this site is 
                                intuitive by making the menu bar fixed to the top no matter where 
                                you scroll

                                It would be wrong to assume our users are all in urban areas. While
                                the assumption is that if you have a modern device, you would most
                                likely be in an urban area, that is not the case. In urban areas, people
                                can more easily find professionals to talk to for niche subjects. But
                                what comes of the rural population? For the formerly-incarcerated,
                                or users wanting to learn about the division between formerly-incarcerated
                                and the public, we want to connect them to professionals that can help 
                                them with their questions and struggles. While they might not be able
                                to meet face to face, we have the power to connect these professionals
                                and our users through online chat, webcam, and more.
